# Description

- Path finding algorithms implementation using React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Anime.js.

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node `v20.8.0` or later.
- pnpm `8.12.1` or later.

# Installing the project

- **Clone** or **download as ZIP** this repository.
- Open repository folder.
- Install the dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Run the development server: `pnpm dev`

# Using Path Finding

- **Left** mouse click will add or remove objects.
- You can select your algorithm / heuristic from top left corner.
- When you are ready, click to `Start` button.

# Features

- Current algorithms:
  - A\*
  - Dijkstra
  - Breadth-first Search
- For **A\*** algorithm, you can choose different _heuristic_ approaches:
  - Manhattan
  - Euclidean
- You can generate mazes. Maze generation algorithm:
  - Recursive backtracking(DFS)
